One of the reasons I work on [Simon Likes Maps]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _projects/slm.md %}) is that I can add features I want that are not readily elsewhere. One of these is gradient highlighting for steep routes. This is especially useful for route planning in avalanche terrain.

I've added highlighting to the elevation profile to pick out the classes of slope that are considered dangerous. This data must be used carefully, though, because it is not always perfect. The reasons why are explained in more detail [here](http://www.simonlikesmaps.com/maps#view=HelpView/tab=tab-elevation).
