title: A Bootstrap 4 Jekyll Portfolio Theme

I've built my own Bootstrap 4 theme for this Jekyll site. It is built with minimal configuration and  does not have much flexibility, but it is quite simple. I've released it on GitHub. (coming shortly!)

###Features

* A 2-column portfolio and blog theme
* Responsive. On small screens, the 2nd column drops to the bottom, so it does not get in the way of content
* Easy to install, with minimal dependencies (but not yet packaged as a theme gem)
* Easy to configure, with minimal options - albeit not that flexible
* Boostrap 4 CSS. No SCSS and no style customisations. Minimal extra theme CSS. Roll your own Bootstrap 4 to change the look and feel
* Bootstrap 4 HTML throughout
* Entypo SVG icons included
* Pygments syntax higlighting using the Monokai syntax theme
* Support for tags and a tag archive page, with a little bit of JS to make the tag display more useful
* Some data files to make it easy to change the nav and profile links
