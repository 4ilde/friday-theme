I'm a freelance web developer based in New Mills near Manchester, UK. I build web applications and software using JavaScript, Python, PHP and Go and web sites using systems like WordPress.

I can work as a freelancer on your development team or I can run a project for you from start to finish.

I'm always interested to hear about new projects - [send me an email]({{site.data.links.email}})
if you have something I could work on.
