<hr />

I've got 19 years commercial experience. I've worked on large projects, such as performance tuning a major investment company's fund trading web application, and small projects, such as helping charities sort out their web sites for free. I've worked in consulting as well as development and on all stages of a project's lifecycle, from pre-sales through to support, and I've led development teams and project teams

I studied Computer Science at Cambridge University, 1997-2000.
